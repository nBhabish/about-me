## Bio

Originally from Nepal, I attended the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for my Bachelor's degree from 2017 to 2021. My first name is pronounced Va-vish-yuh (three syllables). During leisure, I enjoy playing & watching soccer (or football), basketball, volleyball, and foosball (table soccer). I am also a massive Manchester United fan. 

__A little about my family__: My parents are both teachers by occupation and are in Nepal. I have got two older siblings, and both of them are doctors. Everyone in my family enjoys soccer.
